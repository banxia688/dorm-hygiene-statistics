# How to use it
Main file: dorm_hygiene_stat.py

Before run the main file:
create a txt file in files/dorm_hygiene_info, then put all the formatted information(Do not include duplicate lines) this month in it

This .txt file should be named in the following format: **[current_year] [current_month] Info**

For example, '**2025 May Info.txt**'

Then run the script on terminal: 

`py dorm_hygiene_stat.py`

Finally, you will see a xlsx file generated in folder: files/dorm_hygiene_statistics/[current_year]/xxx.xlsx
